Example library 3

This is an example Zotero library with an alternative layout. It displays both the item list and details side by side as the Zotero client does, with the collections/tags panel sliding out in a drawer from the left side. It also stores collections and tags in local storage and only pulls down new/updated versions on reload.

It takes advantage of flexbox and CSS animations, so it will only work in certain browsers. 

Tested in Firefox 20 and Chrome 24.
